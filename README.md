# Creatures
"Creatures" is the android app that allows you to create an account and fight with other users, who also have an account in the application. Players can manage their creatures, create new ones, and earn more points, which will allow them to manage their creatures again and create new creatures if they lose them in the fight. The app uses Room DB to store information about each player and its creatures. Due to the limitations of Room DB, there is a type converter that converts creature objects of every player into a JSON format. Delete sign(cross) in Home and Admin activities added to the ListView via customs adapter.
